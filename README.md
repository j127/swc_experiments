# README

Experimenting with SWC.

The [docs say](https://swc.rs/docs/configuration/bundling):

> Note: CommonJS is currently required. In the future, ES Modules will be supported.

The code in this repo transpiles, but it doesn't bundle the import.

[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) seems more practical for quick things, but I'm not sure if v2 supports custom names for the output files.
